    "shot_type": "Slow, smooth push-in from a medium shot to a medium close-up",
    "format": "16:9",
    "camera": "Sony Alpha 1",
    "lens": "85mm F1.4 G Master lens (for a beautiful, soft-focus background)",
    "camera_motion": "The shot starts as a stable medium shot. As she finishes her wave and begins to speak around 00:02, the camera executes a slow, synchronized push-in, reframing to a medium close-up that feels engaging and personal. The shot holds this framing until the end.",
    "frame_rate": "29.97 fps",
    "film_grain": "Very subtle, fine grain to give a soft, organic texture."
  },
  "behaviour": {
    "00:02": "Friendly wave to the camera with her right hand.",
    "00:04": "She lowers her hand to a relaxed position. Her expression is bright, welcoming, and energetic as she looks directly into the camera and begins speaking."

    "line": "Hey there, beautiful people! Hope you're having an awesome day. Keep smiling, keep shining — better days are always ahead!",

      "Inconsistent voice pitch or tone.",
      "Any morphing, glitching, or distortion of her hands or fingers.",
