{
  "composition": {
    "shot_type": "Dynamic high-angle orbiting 'top-down' shot",
    "format": "1:1 Square Format (for an intimate, focused, portrait-like feel)",
    "camera": "ARRI Alexa 65 (for its large sensor and beautiful color rendition)",
    "lens": "50mm ARRI Signature Prime lens (for a clean, natural, and flattering perspective)",
    "camera_motion": "The camera begins directly above the woman, orbiting smoothly in perfect sync with her spin. From 00:02 to 00:05, her spin and the camera's orbit gently accelerate, creating a more intense spiraling visual. The camera pushes in slightly to a tighter medium shot on her face. From 00:06 to 00:08, the spin and orbit gracefully decelerate, giving the shot a sense of gentle conclusion.",
    "frame_rate": "Captured at 48 fps and rendered at 23.98 fps to create a subtle, ethereal slow-motion effect that enhances the grace of the movement without making it static.",
    "film_grain": "Very fine, almost imperceptible grain to add a soft, organic texture."
  },
  "main_subject": {
    "description": "A 24-year-old woman with an expression of pure, serene joy. Her head is tilted back, gazing upward toward the camera. Freckles are visible across her cheeks and nose. Loose strands of her auburn/chestnut hair fly outwards, catching the light. Her visible eye—a clear emerald or hazel—gleams with wonder.",
    "wardrobe": "A beautiful flower crown of winter blossoms and frosted leaves. A thick, cream-colored knit wool scarf. A deep green or charcoal-colored heavy wool coat, its surface dusted with delicate, pristine snowflakes.",
    "behaviour": "She spins continuously and fluidly, with her arms extended outward parallel to the ground. Her motion is smooth and controlled, varying slightly in speed throughout the shot. She appears completely at peace and filled with warmth, despite the cold setting."
  },
  "secondary_subject": {
    "description": "A small, joyful penguin (e.g., an Adélie penguin). It appears utterly delighted.",
    "behaviour": "It trots in a happy, tight circle on the snow, perfectly matching the woman's spinning pace. Its tiny feet shuffle with playful energy, and its flippers are held slightly out from its sides as if mimicking her extended arms. It frequently looks up at her with adoration."
  },
  "background_element": {
    "description": "A classic, static three-ball snowman, positioned just beyond the dancer's spinning radius. It has charcoal eyes, a carrot nose, and wears a bright red scarf that flutters gently in the breeze, providing a single point of subtle, random motion.",
    "behaviour": "The snowman is perfectly still, adding a touch of whimsical, quiet charm and acting as a stable anchor point in the rotating scene."
  },
  "scene_description": {
    "location": "A secluded, open clearing within a frosted birch forest.",
    "time_of_day": "Golden Hour in winter, just before sunset on Saturday.",
    "environment": "The ground is a blanket of smooth, untouched snow. The landscape glows with apricot and rose-gold hues where lit by the sun, with deep, soft cobalt blue shadows. The frosted birch trees in the background sparkle, scattering the sunlight like tiny prisms.",
    "atmospheric_elements": "The crisp air is visibly filled with glittering, suspended ice crystals (diamond dust). Her warm breath mists briefly and catches the golden light as she exhales."
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "action": "The texture of the cream wool scarf is clearly visible as the light hits it. The delicate snowflakes on her coat flare and glint as they catch the sun during her spin. Her auburn hair strands look like molten gold in the backlight. A slight, natural motion blur on the background and her hands emphasizes the speed of the spin.",
    "props": "Flower crown, knit scarf, snowman with a red scarf.",
    "effects": "Beautiful, soft, and organic lens flares appear as the orbiting camera catches the low sun through the trees. A gentle, dreamlike 'bloom' effect on the highlights. A soft bokeh effect on the background trees."
  },
  "cinematographic_style": {
    "lighting": "Soft, directional, and warm golden hour light. A strong, warm key light bathes her upturned face, while cool, soft fill light is bounced from the snow below, preventing harsh shadows.",
    "tone": "Ethereal, heartwarming, serene, magical, peaceful, and awe-inspiring. A moving portrait of winter joy.",
    "color_grading": "A painterly, richly saturated color palette. Warm apricot, rose-gold, and cream tones in the highlights. Deep cobalt blues and gentle purples in the shadows. The green of her coat and the snowman's red scarf are key color accents."
  },
  "emotional_tone": "Serene joy, wonder, peacefulness, warmth, awe, magical connection.",
  "audio_cues": {
    "ambient": "Almost complete silence, allowing the music to be the primary sound.",
    "music": "An elegant, emotional, and sweeping orchestral string piece (e.g., featuring a solo cello and violin) or a soft, ambient classical track. The music's tempo and intensity should swell and recede in perfect sync with the dancer's spinning motion.",
    "sound_effects": "Very subtle and mixed low: the near-silent whisper of her coat fabric turning and the faint, soft crunch of the penguin's feet in the snow.",
    "dialogue": null
  },
  "technical_notes": {
    "animation_priority": "Absolute stability of all three characters is crucial. The woman's facial features and clothing, the penguin's shape, and the snowman's form and position must not morph, flicker, or distort during the complex orbiting shot.",
    "focus_priority": "Maintain a tack-sharp focus on the woman's upturned face, particularly her eyes and the freckles on her cheeks. The background should fall off into a soft, pleasing blur.",
    "avoid": [
      "Dizzying, jerky, or nauseating camera movement; the orbit must be perfectly smooth and graceful.",
      "Harsh or flat lighting that diminishes the golden hour magic.",
      "The penguin looking unrealistic or cartoonish.",
      "Any signs of distress or feeling cold on the woman's face; she should radiate warmth."
